What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is when you create a new commit that contains all the changes 
in the main branch and your current feature branch.
A rebase takes all the main branches contents, and you start all your 
commits from the current main branch. Your previous commits are now 
new commits starting from the current main branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a collection of changes that can be accessed by 
everyone working on that project. It is generally hosted on a server
separate from your computer.
